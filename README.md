# Study Curator Skeleton

The project provides a basic structure and scripts for kickstarting curatorships of longitudinal studies. This is a modification of a more general skeleton developed by Will Beasley [https://github.com/wibeasley/RAnalysisSkeleton/](https://github.com/wibeasley/RAnalysisSkeleton/), optimized to work with longitudinal studies of the [IALSA](http://www.ialsa.org/) network. 

Only the files unique to study curatorship are stored here. The scripts to be imported from the [RAnalysisSkeleton]https://github.com/wibeasley/RAnalysisSkeleton/) are recommened at the relevant locations.
